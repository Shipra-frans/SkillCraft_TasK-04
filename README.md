Web Scraping Using Python

🕸️ Web Scraping with Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas)
This project demonstrates how to perform web scraping using Python libraries: BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas. It fetches data from a target website, parses the HTML content, extracts the desired information, and organizes it into a structured format (like CSV or DataFrame).

🔧 Technologies Used:
BeautifulSoup (bs4) – For parsing HTML and navigating the DOM tree.
Requests – For sending HTTP requests and fetching web pages.
Pandas – For organizing, cleaning, and exporting the scraped data.

📌 Features:
Send HTTP requests to web pages and retrieve content.
Parse and navigate HTML structure to extract specific data (text, links, tables, etc.).
Convert extracted data into a clean and structured pandas DataFrame.
Export data to CSV or Excel for further analysis.

📝 Example Use Cases:
Scraping product data from e-commerce sites.
Collecting job listings from job portals.
Extracting articles or headlines from news websites.
Gathering tabular data from public information sites.
